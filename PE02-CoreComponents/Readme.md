**Input:**

The CoreComponents Mobile App allows users to input their favorite course by entering a course code, such as "CS624", into the provided text input field. This user input is dynamic and serves as a personalized parameter for the app's content display.

**Process:**

Upon receiving the user's input, the app dynamically incorporates it into the displayed content. The inputted course code is seamlessly integrated into the app's predefined lists of core courses, depth of study courses, and the capstone course. These course listings are static elements within the application. The app processes the input in real-time, providing a customized view based on the user's specified course preference.

**Output:**

The app generates an output that combines the static course information with the user's input. This output is presented in a scrollable format, ensuring an accessible user experience.
