**Input**  
The input for the program is static and doesn't need any user input. In the application, input refers to the text messages that are hardcoded within the Text components in the App.js file. The input serves as the initial data that the program processes and displays in the App.

**Process**  
The core of the program lies in the App component defined in the App.js file. Within the component, the input texts are processed through React Native's Text and View components. The StyleSheet.create function is utilized to define styles, ensuring that the output is visually appealing. Below are the stylings applied,

flex : allows the View component to occupy the entire screen space.  
justifyContent and alignItems : ensure the content is centered both vertically and horizontally, creating a visually balanced output.  
backgroundColor: changes the background color of the view to yellow.  

**Output**  
The output of the program is the graphical user interface displayed on the mobile device. It consists of a single screen with the text given centered both vertically and horizontally. This output is achieved by applying the styling properties to the View component.
